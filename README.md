# ðŸ›  New Construction Options ðŸ› 

C&C: New Construction Options (NCO) is an enhanced game engine for `Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn` & `Command & Conquer:Red Alert`. It's goals are to enhance the gameplay and modding experience.

This project aims to provide an out-of-the-box experience that looks and feels like the original games while giving users unprecedented control over customization and enhancements through in-game menus, INI file configuration and Lua scripting.

> This project is a fork of [Vanilla Conquer](https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer) 

_**Note on GitHub fork networks**: I removed this repo from the `Vanilla Conquer` network as GitHub defaults PRs for this repo to the upstream of the fork, which is annoying. This is the only reason I don't have the fork link in place currently. I will move it back into the network when GitHub allows setting the default base repo for all new PRs._

**EVA: "NOT READY"**

This project is under construction and intial development, so no release builds are available yet - I am working on refactoring and behind the scenes changes first.
