This page records what features I plan to implement in the future. This is all very lose, I will prioritise this list later - nothing is final.

As I decide what items to work on next, I'll add a feature request to this repo [here](https://github.com/djfdyuruiry/cnc-new-construction-options/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Aenhancement).

## General

- Add a automated installer for fetching data files from online ISO sources (since these are available as freeware)
	- Essentially automating: https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer/wiki/Installing-VanillaTD and https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer/wiki/Installing-VanillaRA
	- Have options to choose your mode (Demo, DOS, Full)
	- Should support \*nix (Linux, MacOSX) and Windows
	- Should be UI optionally (Avalonia? dotnet standalone?)
- Comprehensive documentation and tools for modders
	- Including API documentation (Lua, INI, YAML etc.)
- Good mocking tools to make testing complex scenarios and mods easy
- New functionality should replace or enhance old logic, in a opt-in manner

## Tiberian Dawn

- Clone some key enhancements the NCO mode [[TD] ðŸ›  NCO ðŸ›  (RULES.INI ðŸ“ƒ & Lua Scripting âš™)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2147631402)
  - Rally Points
  - A* Path Finding
	- Multiple Harvesters per Refinery (skirmish fix)
  - Commando Guard Rule
	- Modern Wall Building
	- Configuration via INI files for easy customization (authentic C&C modding experience)
		- Bring RULES.INI up to the same level as Red Alert
	- Event handling using Lua scripts
		- Ability to control scenario flow from Lua scripts, similar to OpenRA
		- New scripting APIs to access more game engine functionality
- Clone some key enhancements from Nyerguds' [C&C Gold 1.06 patch project](http://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/cnc95upd/cc95p106/)
	- Snow theatre
	- CNC Net support
- Option to use YAML files instead for modern comforts
- Make the Scenario Editor usable
- Move strings out to a config file (.ENG etc. files)
  - Use locale files
- Simple mod loading system
	- Ability to replace files gradually and add new ones, similar to original MIX file logic
- Rework save games to use a non-binary format to make them portable

## Red Alert

*Nothing here for now*

## Technical changes

Alot of these are behind the scenes or DevOps oriented changes, these aren't really for people who just want to play the game or build mods.

- Make some opinionated technical choices to improve DevOps experience (building/packaging)
- Use `vcpkg` to source dependencies automatically
- [wiki] Create badges for enhancement status instead of html (GitHub wiki not supporting color css)
- Slowly move select game logic out of the core engine
- Attempt to keep compatible where possible with original material
  - Old formats for maps, media files etc. should not have breaking changes
